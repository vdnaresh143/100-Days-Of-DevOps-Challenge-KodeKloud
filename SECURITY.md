## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

- **Email**: [security@imshakil.33mail.com](mailto:security@imshakil.33mail.com)
- **Subject**: "Security Issue - kkDevOps Challenge"
- **Do NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities

### 📋 Include in Your Report

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if known)

## Security Best Practices

### 🔐 Credentials & Secrets

- **Never commit** real credentials, API keys, or passwords
- Use placeholder values like `<your-api-key>`, `<your-token>`
- Review all files before committing
- Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files

### 🐧 Linux Security

- Use `sudo` instead of root login
- Configure SSH key-based authentication
- Disable SSH root access
- Set proper file permissions (chmod, chown)
- Enable SELinux/AppArmor when applicable
- Regular security updates

### 🐳 Docker Security

- Use official base images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Run containers as non-root user
- Limit container resources
- Use multi-stage builds
- Keep images updated

### ☸️ Kubernetes Security

- Use RBAC for access control
- Enable Pod Security Standards
- Scan container images
- Use network policies
- Secure secrets with encryption
- Regular cluster updates

### 🔧 Ansible Security

- Use Ansible Vault for secrets
- Limit playbook permissions
- Use become with specific users
- Validate input parameters
- Use SSH keys for authentication

### 🌐 Web Server Security

- **Nginx/Apache**: Use SSL/TLS certificates
- Disable unnecessary modules
- Configure proper headers
- Regular security patches
- Use fail2ban for brute force protection

### 🗄️ Database Security

- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Use strong passwords
- Limit network access
- Enable SSL connections
- Regular backups
- Apply security patches

### ☁️ Terraform/AWS Security

- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Enable CloudTrail logging
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Use least privilege principle
- Regular security audits
- Store state files securely

### 🔄 CI/CD Security (Jenkins)

- Secure Jenkins installation
- Use credentials plugin
- Limit build permissions
- Scan code for vulnerabilities
- Secure pipeline configurations

## Safe Learning Environment

### 🧪 Lab Environment

- Use isolated test environments (VMs, containers)
- Don't run untested code in production
- Clean up AWS resources after practice
- Monitor costs and usage
- Use separate AWS accounts for testing

### 🔍 Code Review

- All configurations are reviewed
- Security implications considered
- Best practices enforced
- Community feedback encouraged

## Tool-Specific Security Considerations

### Git Security

- Use SSH keys for repository access
- Sign commits with GPG keys
- Review commit history for secrets
- Use branch protection rules

### Container Security

- Scan Docker images with tools like Trivy
- Use distroless or minimal base images
- Implement container runtime security
- Monitor container behavior

### Infrastructure Security

- Use infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- Version control all configurations
- Implement change management
- Regular security assessments

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity
