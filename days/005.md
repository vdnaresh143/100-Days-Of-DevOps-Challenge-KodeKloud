# Install and Configuration Selinux

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 2 in the Stratos Datacenter:

- Install the required SELinux packages.
- Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.
- No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.
- Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

## Steps

1. Install selinux packages:

    ```sh
    sudo dnf install selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils
    ```

2. Modify file in `/etc/selinux/config:

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
    ```

    add this line:

    ```nano
    SELINUX=disabled
    ```

## Good to Know?

### SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)

- **Purpose**: Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security framework
- **Modes**: Enforcing, Permissive, Disabled
- **Policies**: Targeted (default), Strict, MLS (Multi-Level Security)
- **Context**: Every file/process has security context (user:role:type:level)

### SELinux States

- **Enforcing**: Policies actively enforced, violations blocked
- **Permissive**: Policies logged but not enforced (audit mode)
- **Disabled**: SELinux completely turned off

### Key Commands

- `getenforce`: Check current SELinux mode
- `setenforce 0/1`: Temporarily set permissive/enforcing
- `sestatus`: Detailed SELinux status
- `sealert`: Analyze SELinux denials

### Configuration Files

- `/etc/selinux/config`: Main configuration
- `/var/log/audit/audit.log`: SELinux violations
- `/etc/selinux/targeted/`: Policy files
